# Global Claude Code Instructions

This file loads for **every** Claude Code session, across every project.
Project-specific rules belong in that project's `CLAUDE.md`
(e.g. `/path/to/your/project/CLAUDE.md`).

## Learned Preferences (auto-compiled — do not edit here)

## HARD RULE — This file is a pointer only

No content except file paths, this pointer table, and skill triggers.
If you are about to add anything else — STOP. Find or create the right MD file and point to it instead.

## Maintenance Rules (Boris Cherny)

- If a rule above stops working, **nuke it and rewrite**. Do not preserve broken guidance.
- Review this file weekly. Trim, don't add.
- Keep concise. Project specifics belong in project CLAUDE.md.

Keep these scripts unless caveman mode is no longer wanted.
