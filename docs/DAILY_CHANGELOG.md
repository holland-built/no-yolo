# Changelog

## 2026-07-10 (plan 017 — reference-URL scraping in design skills)

- `/design` + `/design-audit`: reference-URL support — when the request names a site ("make it look like this <url>"), scrape it via the self-hosted Firecrawl (`firecrawl-py`, `formats=["html"]`) and seed/inject its real palette·type·spacing tokens instead of guessing. `/design` folds tokens into the brand seed (Step 0); `/design-audit` injects them into the F3 fix mockups alongside the P0 findings. Graceful fallback to Radix/Open-Color if the scrape fails. `/quick-mockup` intentionally excluded (placeholder-only by design). Uses the same Python path as `/ingest-docs`; no MCP restart needed. (Opus-planned as advisor-plans/017, built + verified in an isolated worktree, live scrape smoke test passed.)

## 2026-07-09 (cont'd, plan 003 — template hooks fixed)

- fixed `settings.example.json`: all 6 hook/statusLine commands used `node "~/.claude/hooks/…"` — a quoted `~` never expands in a POSIX shell, so every fresh install threw a failing hook on every session event, had no status line, and the lockstep edit-gate failed open. Now `"$HOME/.claude/hooks/…"` (expands correctly); verified all 6 exit 0
- `setup.sh`: replaced the stale "update node path" instruction (the template had no node path to update) with "ensure 'node' is on PATH for GUI-launched apps"; removed the `enabledPlugins: caveman@caveman` block that pre-enabled a plugin the base install doesn't ship (marketplace registration kept)
- `SHIP.md` Step 9 hardened: now hard-fails on any quoted-`~` hook path and matches both `$HOME/` and `~/` forms when checking hook existence — the release gate can't pass a broken-path template again (executed via /improve in an isolated worktree, reviewed, merged)

## 2026-07-09 (cont'd, README trim + prompt-scan refresh)

- README.md trimmed 410 → 194 lines (task J's <200 target restored): "Cut the noise" section now 4 lines pointing at `settings.example.json`, setup-step table dropped (script self-documents), command-table descriptions cut to one clause, directory layout collapsed — all 17 README_FORMAT.md headings and all 28 command rows kept
- `/prompt-scan` run for real on Sonnet 5: learnings.md §1-5 snapshot restamped (§4 regenerated from SKILL_TRIGGERS.md — now includes /build, /release two-way update wording), new §6 entry for 2026-07-09 (Fable 5 default set, Claude Code 2.1.200-2.1.205 deltas); nudge hook verified reading it

## 2026-07-09 (cont'd, enhancement batch)

- tests for `hooks/caveman-mode-tracker.js` — the repo's highest-churn untested file: 14 node:test cases (mode transitions, NL activation/deactivation, invalid input, flag round-trip in temp dir), all passing via `node --test 'hooks/tests/*.test.js'`; tracker got a `module.exports` block + `main()` wrapper, CLI behavior unchanged
- `/update` fork/upstream/force-push flow removed (SKILL.md sync-and-run block) — this repo IS `holland-built/no-yolo`, the fork branch served nobody; sync is pinned to `origin/main`
- plugin-listing snippet deduped: new shared `hooks/list-plugins.py` (TSV out), called by both `setup.sh` Step 5 and `/update`'s plugin-status step — one source of truth
- `SHIP.md` hardened: Step 8 now checks RENDERED taglines match TAGLINES.md verbatim (catches the drift class fixed by hand today); new Step 9 HARD BLOCK — `settings.example.json` must parse and every referenced hook script must exist (the `log-learnings-stop.sh` class of bug can't ship again)
- deleted empty orphaned `skills/learned/` dir

## 2026-07-09 (cont'd, full /review health pass — 31 fixes)

- `hooks/statusline.sh` — removed leftover debug line that dumped the full statusline stdin JSON (transcript path, cost) to `/tmp/sl-stdin-*.json` on every render
- `settings.example.json` — removed Stop-hook entry for nonexistent `log-learnings-stop.sh` (fresh installs got a failing hook every turn); fixed playwright allowlist prefix to `mcp__plugin_ecc_playwright__*` (old `mcp__playwright__*` never matched); dropped unconfigured `mcp__filesystem__*` and legacy duplicate `voiceEnabled` key
- docs de-drifted after the /ship→/release, /design-full→/design, /code-review+/code-health→/review, /plan-feature+/build-feature→/build consolidations: `SKILLS.md` Daily-Driver table rewritten, `UI_MOCKUPS.md` routes + plans-path fixed, `SUBAGENTS.md` dead agents removed, `CODE_REVIEW.md` retitled, `CONTEXT_VOCAB.md` fact-path + gateguard row fixed
- duplicate rules consolidated to single owners: "Opus plans, Sonnet codes" → `SUBAGENTS.md`; skill-authoring rules → `NO_YOLO.md`; GUI-slop fingerprint → `ANTISLOP.md` pointer; Caveman section in `CLAUDE.md` → `HOOKS.md` pointer; token-bloat rule → `CONTEXT.md`
- deleted 4 orphaned my-skills catalog files (`HOW_TO_USE.md`, `BOLT_ONS.md`, `RELATIONSHIPS.md`, empty `PLUGIN_PACKS.md`) — nothing read them and two duplicated `STORIES.md` data; md-check's orphan checker updated to stop parsing `RELATIONSHIPS.md`
- stale numbers fixed everywhere: 27 commands (was 28), 8 core rules (was 5), /design = 10 mockups 8 paradigms + 2 wild (was 7) across README, STORIES, RENDERED, WHY_TO_USE
- added missing `/quick-mockup` README row and `/build` trigger block in `SKILL_TRIGGERS.md`; deleted duplicate `better_prompt` story line and dead `rel:code-health`/`rel:code-review` lines
- dead code trimmed: 14 unused exports dropped from `caveman-stats.js`, 1 (`getConfigPath`) from `caveman-config.js` — both invoked as subprocesses, never required
- `.gitignore` now covers runtime artifacts `.claude.json`, `.claude/`, `chrome/`, `debug/`; `SHIP.md` line added to `GLOBAL_DESCRIPTIONS.md`

## 2026-07-09 (cont'd, session-tuning settings)

- added 6 settings to `settings.example.json` (the only settings file this repo commits — `settings.json` itself stays gitignored, per-machine): `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_FEEDBACK_SURVEY`, `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`, `DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING`, `DISABLE_NON_ESSENTIAL_MODEL_CALLS`, `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE: "75"` (compacts before quality degrades near the 95% default limit, not after), and top-level `spinnerTipsEnabled: false`. New README section explains what each does and how to add them by hand if you already have an older `settings.json`

## 2026-07-09

- `/my-skills`' menu (`CATEGORIES.md`/`RENDERED*.md`) only listed `improve` among borrowed plugins, not `trim` — an inconsistency, not a break: fixed by adding `trim`, then removed both `trim` and `design-audit` again per explicit preference (menu should reflect what's actually typed, not every real skill) — `TAGLINES.md`'s "6-persona" debate typo (should be 7) fixed along the way, confirmed clean by `/md-check --orphans` both times since neither skill's catalog/trigger entries elsewhere were touched
- wired Paper MCP into `/design-audit`'s fix pipeline as a conditional branch (F0.5 + F3-PAPER): fires only when Paper Desktop is connected AND the target is a single component, matching Paper's own "small sections, not whole pages" guidance — builds up to 6 live variants on the canvas instead of static HTML, picks via screenshot, pulls exact values via `get_jsx`/`get_computed_styles` for the build step. Full-page fixes stay on the existing Chrome/HTML path unconditionally. `RELATIONSHIPS.md` updated to match

- `/design` was missing the reuse/simplicity gate `/build` already had — added Step 4.6: for every new component/hook/util the build introduces, grep for an existing sibling first (reuse it, don't twin it); run `/trim` on the new files if 3+ new components land or a duplicate pattern shows up. Updated `RELATIONSHIPS.md`'s dependency row to match

## 2026-07-07 (cont'd, added emilkowalski/skills)

- installed `emilkowalski/skills` (Vaul/Sonner author's animation/design-eng taste rules) via `npx skills@latest add emilkowalski/skills` — 3 skills: `emil-design-eng`, `animation-vocabulary`, `review-animations`
- caught and fixed a placement bug in the installer itself: it dropped symlinks into a nested `~/.claude/.claude/skills/` (project-scoped, only live when a session's cwd is exactly `~/.claude`) instead of this repo's own `skills/` — added the correct flat symlinks matching the existing `trim`/`improve` pattern. Left the nested `.claude/.claude/settings.local.json` alone — real accumulated permission history, not installer junk
- wired `emil-design-eng` into `/design` Step 1 (motion decisions when `MOTION_INTENSITY` is non-baseline) and `review-animations` into `/design-audit`'s Taste lens (motion surfaces only) — both skip silently if not installed
- cataloged all 3 in `TAGLINES/WHEN_TO_USE/WHY_TO_USE/STORIES/RELATIONSHIPS.md` and `.gitignore` so `/my-skills` surfaces them and `/md-check --orphans` doesn't flag them

## 2026-07-07 (cont'd, /md-check --fix)

- ran `/md-check --fix` for real: found + removed 12 dangling `lazyweb-*` entries from `TAGLINES.md`/`WHEN_TO_USE.md`/`WHY_TO_USE.md` — these are Lazyweb MCP internals, not slash commands, and never belonged in the skill catalogs
- found a bonus dangling reference while in `NO_YOLO.md`: it told people to run `/publish-skills`, a skill retired long ago and replaced by `/release` — fixed the pointer and completed the checklist (was missing the TAGLINES/WHEN_TO_USE/WHY_TO_USE steps)
- trimmed README.md's "Add a new skill" section from 36 lines to 4 — it fully duplicated `NO_YOLO.md`'s checklist, now the single source of truth (419 → 389 lines; still over the 200-line soft cap, accepted tradeoff for the primary onboarding doc)

## 2026-07-07 (cont'd)

- added `/md-check --orphans` — checks two directions: does a catalog file (TAGLINES/STORIES/WHEN_TO_USE/WHY_TO_USE/RELATIONSHIPS/SKILL_TRIGGERS) describe a skill that no longer exists (DANGLING), and does a real skill sit unreferenced anywhere a user would find it (UNREFERENCED). Wired into `SHIP.md` Step 3.5 so every `/release` runs it automatically
- ran it for real and found + fixed 6 dangling names: `code-review`/`code-health` (retired into `/review`, but 6 catalog files still described them as live) and `graphify`/`design-full`/`design-fix`/`token-hunt` (real tool or fully-retired skills wrongly documented as their own commands) — fixed across `BOLT_ONS.md`, `HOW_TO_USE.md`, `WHEN_TO_USE.md`, `TAGLINES.md`, `WHY_TO_USE.md`, `RELATIONSHIPS.md`
- fixed two bugs in the orphan-checker itself found while running it: it never parsed `RELATIONSHIPS.md`'s `| name | ...` row format, and a regex artifact matched a stray leading `-` as a fake skill name
- deleted the duplicate local `/impeccable` skill (gitignored, unbacked-up, original content) per explicit choice to use the real `pbakaus/impeccable` plugin instead — `/design`'s existing-UI redirect now points at the real plugin, documented as an install command in README rather than duplicated
- un-vendored taste-skill from git (was committed as a full copy, against this repo's own `.gitignore` convention that other people's work stays local) — gitignored the vendor dir, rewrote `THIRD_PARTY_SKILLS.md` as an install-pointer doc, `/update vendor <name>` now handles first install too
- ran `/md-check --drift` for real (previously skipped in favor of ad-hoc greps) and fixed 5 real drift findings in `SKILL_TRIGGERS.md`: `update`, `release`, `md-check`, and `design` all omitted real behavior added this session; `design-audit`'s "zero mockups" claim flatly contradicted its own SKILL.md (predates this session)

- vendored the real taste-skill (Leonxlnx/taste-skill, MIT, pinned commit) into `skills/design/vendor/taste-skill/` — `/design` now actually reads it (Design Read + 3 dials + honest design-system routing) instead of running on the FALLBACKS-only stub
- added `docs/THIRD_PARTY_SKILLS.md` — registry `/update` reads to flag drift on any vendored (non-plugin) third-party content
- `/design` now auto-redirects existing-UI polish language (`polish`, `tighten`, `existing`, `fix the design`, etc.) to `/impeccable`, invoked in the same response — never tells you to retype a command
- `/impeccable` now shares the vendored taste-skill rules with `/design` (redesign-skill.md as its primary Fix driver, taste-skill.md's anti-default checklist in Audit) while its own Scope guard always overrides the dials for documented/intentional design decisions
- `/update` gained real two-way reconciliation: it now checks AHEAD (local commits not pushed) and DIRTY (uncommitted work) in addition to BEHIND, since the old version only checked "is GitHub ahead of me" and silently missed unpublished local work
- `/update` gained two apply commands — `/update vendor <name>` (re-vendor a stale third-party skill from upstream) and `/update marketplace <name>` (git pull a stale orphaned marketplace, e.g. impeccable) — both confirm-gated, the only steps that touch third-party content
- `/update` gained a plugin/marketplace drift check for marketplaces cloned directly (no `installed_plugins.json` entry) that the old plugin-status step silently missed — caught `impeccable` stale by 124 commits, since fixed
- `/release` gained a pre-push sync check (BEHIND only) so it never pushes blind against a moved remote — defers the full picture to `/update` rather than duplicating it
- **correction (same day):** taste-skill was committed as a full copy — against this repo's own convention (`.gitignore` already excludes `plugins/`, `skills/impeccable`, etc.). Un-tracked it, added it to `.gitignore`, rewrote `THIRD_PARTY_SKILLS.md` as an install-pointer doc — `/update vendor <name>` now handles first install, not just re-fetch
- **correction (same day):** discovered two unrelated things both named "impeccable" — a hand-written local skill (gitignored, never backed up) and the real `pbakaus/impeccable` plugin. Deleted the hand-written one per your call; `/design`'s existing-UI redirect now points at the real plugin instead, documented as an install command in README (not uploaded)
- swept every catalog file (STORIES/TAGLINES/WHEN_TO_USE/WHY_TO_USE, README, design/SKILL.md) for the now-fictional "5-lens polish loop" description and the equally-stale claim that `/design-audit`'s "fix it" hands off to `/impeccable` (it never did — self-corrected)
- logged a new lesson in `CORE_RULES.md` under the (also new) Self-learning section: check `.gitignore` convention before vendoring any external repo's files

## 2026-07-05

- added a `--ui` flag to /debate — swaps the default 7 business/eng personas for a 5-persona UI/UX panel (Restraint Auditor, The Operator, Spatial Designer, Accessibility Enforcer, Diagnostician) that reads the project's own design docs first, so it argues by your rules instead of generic taste

## 2026-07-04

- merged /md-fix into /md-check as `--fix` — one skill now both audits (default) and applies fixes (`--fix`, `--auto` to skip the gate); removed the standalone /md-fix skill (md-check is the shared audit primitive other skills call)
- skill-audit fixes: reworded drawio-skill/ingest-docs/supacode-cli descriptions to lead with "Use this skill when"; added a §1–6 header self-check to /prompt-scan (guards /better_prompt); repointed a stale ship/SKILL.md reference in my-skills to SHIP.md
- removed the `/ship` alias skill and killed `/ship` as a trigger phrase entirely — `/release` is the sole publish command
- unified publishing into one command: `/release` — context-aware, reads a repo-root `SHIP.md` playbook and pushes to the right environment (dev/staging/prod); `/ship` is now an alias
- added `~/.claude/SHIP.md` (the skill repo's own release playbook) and the SHIP.md template the skill authors when a repo has none
- `/release` refuses to push a repo with no SHIP.md — it stops (lockstep) and walks you through building one first
- added /md-fix skill: the active counterpart to /md-check — audits your docs, then applies the fixes (dedupe repeated rules, merge overlapping files, trim oversize, correct stale descriptions) behind one approve-all gate; --auto skips the gate
- hardened /prompt-scan release-note fetching: swapped the redirecting docs URLs for direct 2026 endpoints so scans no longer waste retries on redirects
- restructured /prompt-scan output: conventions are now a living snapshot overwritten each scan, model facts are a dated append-only log, and the skill-trigger table is derived from SKILL_TRIGGERS.md instead of retyped
- wired /md-fix into the skill menus, README, and triggers

## 2026-07-02

- added /quick-mockup skill: fast disposable placeholder-only HTML layout mockup, served over http://, auto-opens browser; lightweight counterpart to /design
- wired /quick-mockup into SKILL_TRIGGERS.md, STORIES.md, TAGLINES.md, CATEGORIES.md, TAGLINES_SHORT.md
- rewrote /better-prompt output: now returns only the rewritten prompt in a fenced block, no before/after/why

## 2026-07-01

- un-hid 13 skills back into /my-skills: eli5, debate, code-health (later deleted), plan, my-md, md-check, skill-audit, update, prompt-scan, better-prompt, ingest-docs, drawio-skill, supacode-cli
- added /improve to /my-skills after a debate concluded bare (non-namespaced) third-party skills should be visible regardless of authorship
- deleted /code-health and /code-review entirely — fully superseded by /review, zero unique capability left
- kept /antislop and /tdd hidden but present — each retains a standalone use case its replacement doesn't cover
- decided to keep the whole third-party trim-* family off the menu — three of six are already invoked by /review and /code-health, the other three the user won't use standalone
- added /lockstep — new skill + PreToolUse hook that hard-blocks Edit/Write/NotebookEdit until the user explicitly releases it
- updated /plan: final output now routes through /better_prompt before dispatching the recommended skill, instead of always assuming /build
- added a SessionStart hook that nudges /prompt-scan when the current model differs from the last recorded scan
- added worktree cleanup to /build and /design-audit — merges and removes isolated agent worktrees/branches after use
- redesigned /my-skills default output: paired-column (Skill+What x2), no section headers, 2-5 word summaries — 25 skills collapse to 13 rows, one screen
- added TAGLINES_SHORT.md as the source for the new dense default view; deep mode unchanged
- fixed stale README: removed all references to deleted/nonexistent skills (code-health, code-review, design-full, design-fix, token-hunt, quick-design), rebuilt the Skills inventory table to match what's actually installed
- synced TAGLINES.md/WHEN_TO_USE.md/WHY_TO_USE.md — lockstep was missing entirely, several other rows had drifted from the live RENDERED.md content
- fixed /review's trim-audit/trim-debt/trim-review install checks — were checking the wrong global path and always reporting "missing" even though the skills work; now resolves the actual local symlink
- added a drift guard to /ship's RENDERED.md/RENDERED_FAST.md regen — diffs against the current file before overwriting, warns if source files had drifted, still commits either way
- redesigned /review into one mode: always runs diff review AND whole-codebase health pass together, max effort always, one ranked findings list, one approve-all gate, then fixes everything approved — removed --health/--fix/--comment/--effort flags, kept --auto as an unattended override
- added Core Rule 8: self-check simplest-method + reuse before declaring any coding task done, checked during planning and again after — separate from /review, always on, unprompted
- fixed /plan's Gate: explicitly bans asking a second confirmation question after the user already says "yes" to alignment — was adding an extra unneeded prompt

## 2026-06-30

- improved /last-30 output: removed 40-word bottom line cap (now 3–4 sentences with concrete evidence), added clickable link format rules with long-URL fallback, raised output cap to 300 words
- consolidated 27 visible skills to 11: added /review (unified diff review + codebase health), hid plan/tdd/code-review/code-health/antislop/md-check/prompt-scan/better-prompt/eli5/debate/skill-audit/my-md/update/ingest-docs/drawio-skill/supacode-cli from /my-skills menu
- updated CATEGORIES.md to show exactly 11 skills in 6 sections (Design/Build/Review/Research/Quality/Memory/Meta)
- updated SKILL_TRIGGERS.md: removed code-review and code-health triggers, added /review trigger
- updated /build: /code-health references replaced with /review --health
- updated /impeccable: added adversarial verify gate for Criticals + eli5 round summary
- updated /design: added tsc/lint/build gate before Playwright smoke in main build flow
- set user-invocable: false on 16 hidden skills so they run internally but don't appear in menus
- redesigned /design: 10 mockups (8 paradigms + 2 wild), light+dark side-by-side (5 rows x 2 cols), states strip, annotation callouts, AI scoring agent picks winner, Chrome auto-opens before gate
- redesigned /design-audit: adds fix gate after audit (y/n); y triggers full 10-mockup pipeline scoped to P0 findings, you pick variant, then builds with tsc+lint+Playwright+re-audit
- absorbed /impeccable into /design-audit fix gate; set /impeccable user-invocable: false, removed from CATEGORIES.md and SKILL_TRIGGERS.md
- updated TAGLINES.md, WHEN_TO_USE.md, WHY_TO_USE.md for design and design-audit
- rebuilt RENDERED.md (10 visible skills: 2 Design / 1 Build / 1 Review / 2 Research / 1 Quality / 1 Memory / 3 Meta)

## 2026-06-28

- updated /my-skills index files — added taglines, when-to-use, and why-to-use entries for all lazyweb skills (lazyweb, lazyweb-quick-search, lazyweb-lite-design-research, lazyweb-deep-design-research, lazyweb-design-improve, lazyweb-design-brainstorm, lazyweb-design-best-practices, lazyweb-ab-test-research, lazyweb-optimize-paywall, lazyweb-optimize-sign-up, lazyweb-paywall-cta, lazyweb-update) and /skill-audit

## 2026-06-26

- added /token-hunt skill — finds 5 reference sites matching design intent, extracts CSS tokens from each, outputs stolen-tokens.md for design-full
- updated /design-full — added --steal flag that runs /token-hunt first to seed palette from a real site instead of generating one
- updated all my-skills index files — RELATIONSHIPS, WHEN_TO_USE, WHY_TO_USE, HOW_TO_USE, STORIES, TAGLINES with token-hunt entries
- updated SKILL_TRIGGERS.md — added token-hunt trigger, fixed md-check drift description, updated design-full to three modes
- updated README.md — added token-hunt row, bumped skill count to 28
- fixed MCP config — open-design server was registered in wrong ~/.claude.json (desktop app install vs CLI install); re-registered to correct ~/.claude-work/.claude.json

- wired trim-* symlinks into ~/.claude/skills/ — trim, trim-audit, trim-debt, trim-gain, trim-help, trim-review now show in /my-skills plugin section

- added /design-fix skill — surgical 7-variant mockup for one component; respects current design tokens, no build chain
- added bold redesign enforcement to /design-full — BOLD MODE activates on keywords (new, redesign, fresh, different); variants must be impossible to mistake for current design
- added light+dark mode to all /design-full and /design-audit mockups — 14-section all.html (v1-light through v7-dark) required in both fast and full mode
- design-full always nukes existing design tokens — reads tokens to build explicit ban list; palette injection gives agents fresh hex from Radix/Open Color
- removed Interface Design MCP and Design+Refine MCP from design-full and design-audit pipeline steps
- added shadcn/ui MCP to design pipeline (MIT, open source, official shadcn team)
